# This means that the plugin doesn't need to constantly call Mojang just to find a skin for an offline player
# However some people may prefer to disable this.
# Even if you disable this, if there was disguises in the cache already then it will use them

# This option is useless if you don't enable SaveGameProfiles!

# When they join the server will automatically update the cache in case they changed their skin

# This modifies the bounding box, This is stuff like can a arrow hit them.
# If you turn this to true, arrows will act like they hit the disguise in the right place!
# Clients will not see any difference in the hitboxes they are attacking, this is a server-sided calculation!
# So someone disguised as a enderdragon will easily get shot down by arrows!
# This WILL conflict with NoCheatPlus. Other plugins may also get problems.
# This shouldn't really be enabled for players as it also interferes with their movement because the server thinks
# the player is larger than they really are.
# That makes the player unable to approach this building because the server thinks they are trying to glitch inside
# blocks.
# This feature is highly experimental and is guaranteed to cause problems for players who are disguised

# When a sheep or wolf is right clicked with dye. The client automatically assumes it was successful and displays the sheep's wool or the wolfs collar as dyed.
# This is a option that either prevents that happening, or it changes their color officially in the plugin so that everyone sees it changed.
# Its currently set to false which means that the color is not changed and will refresh itself to the player.
# Please note that this will not remove the dye from their hands. This also does not check if the disguised entity is actually a sheep/wolf and wants a say in its color.

# You shouldn't need to touch this, but if you do; This was added so scoreboard stuff that affects a certain UUID, will still continue to affect that UUID
