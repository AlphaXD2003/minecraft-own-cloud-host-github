# ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CHANGE SETTINGS HERE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU DO!
advanced:
    # <!! Warning !!>
    # Enabling this will stop SkinsRestorer to change skins on join.
    # Handy for when you want run /skin apply to apply skin after texturepack popup
    disableOnJoinSkins: false
    # <!! Warning !!>
    # This enables the PaperMC join event integration that allows instant skins on join.
    # It is recommended over the fallback listener because it is smoother and should not lag the server.
    # It also fixes all resource pack skin apply issues.
    # If your players are experiencing extremely long loading screens, try disabling this.
    enablePaperJoinListener: true
    # <!! Warning !!>
    # This enables the PaperMC async tab event integration that allows async command tab completions.
    # It is recommended over the bukkit command system as tab completions will not lag the server using it.
    # Only disable this if you're overriding a SkinsRestorer command like /skin with a different plugin.
    enablePaperAsyncTabListener: true
    # <!! Warning !!>
    # When enabled if a skin gets applied on the proxy, the new texture will be forwarded to the backend as well.
    # This is optional sometimes as the backend may pick up the new one of the proxy.
    # It is recommended though to **KEEP THIS ON** because it keeps the backend data in sync.
    # This feature is required for solutions like RedisBungee and also fixes bugs in some cases.
    forwardTextures: true
    # <!! Warning !!>
    # When enabled SkinsRestorer will not try to connect to any web server, which means the follow things won't work:
    # Getting new skins from Mojang, looking up uuids of players, skin url, update checking and more.
    # SkinsRestorer will only be able to access already downloaded skins.
    # This is useful for servers that are not connected to the internet or have a firewall blocking connections.
    noConnections: false

# Updater Settings
# <!! Warning !!>
# Using outdated version void's support, compatibility & stability.

# To block all types of automatic updates (which can risk keeping an exploit):
# Create a file called 'noupdate.txt' in the plugin directory (./plugins/SkinsRestorer/ )

# Useful tools:
# Vectier Thailand has made some super cool "Custom Skin" tools that you can use!
# 
# SkinFile Generator:
# With SkinFile Generator, you can upload your own custom skin to get a unique .skin file that you can put in your skins folder, to use with SkinsRestorer.
# Check it out here: https://skinsrestorer.github.io/SkinFile-Generator/
# 
# SkinSystem :
# With SkinSystem, you, as a server owner, can connect AuthMe (and forum) with the SkinSystem website that you can host, to give your players the ability to upload custom skins.
