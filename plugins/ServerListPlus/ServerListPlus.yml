# This section is only for the Bukkit plugin of ServerListPlus.
# ProtocolLib: (DISABLE|AUTO|ENABLE) Decides if ProtocolLib should be used by ServerListPlus.
#   Generally, AUTO (the default) is a good choice: ProtocolLib is used on Spigot for
#   full functionality, but disabled on Paper because it is not needed there.
#   Note that this might cause other plugins that make use of ProtocolLib to overwrite
#   the changes made by ServerListPlus. In that case, try setting ENABLE instead.
