# In this file, you can define custom hats, emotes, suits, or pets! How exciting!

# Format for hats:
# Start with the internal name of the cosmetic, which must be ASCII-only and less than 32 characters.
# For example, "CraftingTable":
#   CraftingTable:
#       # If the hat is a player skull, 'url' should be the end of a texture URL, like if the url is:
#       # http://textures.minecraft.net/texture/9f30ffbc0110efa34e030860da18c8a1d6b223de0f00d9e4c5d0cfa7ecfafa48
#       # Then the 'url' option should be:
#       url: 9f30ffbc0110efa34e030860da18c8a1d6b223de0f00d9e4c5d0cfa7ecfafa48
# Here's another example, this time with custom model data:
#   CarvedPumpkinBlock:
#       # 'type' should be the material name of the hat. If not present (like in the above example,) 'PLAYER_HEAD' is assumed.
#       type: CARVED_PUMPKIN
#       # 'custom-model-data' should be the custom model data of the hat. If not present, 0 is assumed.
#       custom-model-data: 10
# Once the hat is loaded, you will be able to change the display name and description in the messages file.
Hats:

# Format for emotes:
# Again, start with the internal name of the cosmetic. The same rules apply.
# This example is a built-in emote so don't activate it.
#   DealWithIt:
#       # 'ticksPerFrame' is how many ticks should be between each frame change.
#       # 1 second = 20 ticks, so a value of 2 means update 10 times per second.
#       ticksPerFrame: 2
#       # 'urls' should be a list of ends of texture URLs, just like with hats.
#       # But for emotes, you need a list of them.
#       urls:
#       - 72bb8ba79648718fe80687ed4df2b9e284e732583e05658e227efd7fdf80f4

# Again, once it's set up, you can change the name and description in the messages file.
